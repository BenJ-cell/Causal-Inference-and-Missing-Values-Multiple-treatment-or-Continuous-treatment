# Causal-Inference-and-Missing-Values-Multiple-treatment-or-Continuous-treatment
Several methods to estimate the average effect (IPW, g-estimators, AIPW) and heterogeneous effects in the context of binary treatment already exist. The objective of this project was to make a state of the art of the available methods to manage multiple treatments or even continuous treatments (doses).  On the one hand we listed the main estimators and their characteristics. On the other hand we  listed their implementations to compare them empirically by reproducing simulations of a real dataset. It will help us to create recommendations to the users. We proved some results empirically using a notebook written in Python and also try to suggest improvements if needed.
